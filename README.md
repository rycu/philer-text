## For when only Phil puns Phil do!

Using strings of varied length can be very handy when developing robust UI feature; especially when having the account for possible translations.

Now you can do this with Phil puns!! I know right, Phils good! 🤯

### PUN LISTS DONT PHIL THEMSELVES !!

If you've got a Phil pun that's not in the array, don't be afarid to add Phils.
